> Benzon Carlitos Salazar

## About
This is a repo that consists of mainly test cases to showcase my skills in unit
testing using the game of Clue to solve cases as an example and also using 
Python's ***pytest*** and ***unittest***. The main folder for the game is 
[here](./src/clue), and all the important test cases are [here](./src/tests)

## Test cases implemented
* [Test card triples](./src/tests/test_card.py)
* [Test command-line interface](./src/tests/test_cli.py) -- ***In progress***
